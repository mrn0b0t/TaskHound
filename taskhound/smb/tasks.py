# Helpers for enumerating and reading scheduled task XMLs over SMB.
#
# This module traverses the C:\Windows\System32\Tasks directory on a
# remote host using Impacket's SMB APIs and returns a list of (path, data)
# pairs containing the task XML bytes. The implementation intentionally
# keeps errors non-fatal: unreadable files are logged and skipped so a
# single permission issue doesn't abort the entire crawl.
